# DinoAI
This project is an AI to play the chrome dinosaur game. It takes screenshots and looks for objects and jumps if need be. It can run for a very long time so if you need your computer midway through, you can always alt+tab out when it is not jumping. To run the AI, run the Main.java class. It will ask you if you need to set it up (first time yes). Make sure you have the chrome dinosaur game in fullscreen for the best results (chrome://dino). It is also best if you run once before both for fun and to set a human result against it.
